Google Homepage Front-end
This project is part of The Odin Project open-source Web Development course.

The purpose of this project is to create the front-end of the Google homepage using HTML and CSS.

Some lessons learned:
1. Always double check class and id spellings.
2. Classes are more general and can be applied to more than one element. Id's are more specific and take precedent over classes.
3. Use a div class (CSS) to style the spacing of elements within the div. Try to use flex or grid if it makes sense.
4. For styling the look of a component, give that component (or groups of components) a class
5. To style a type of input in a form, use input[type=text]
6. In order to move components as flex items, its parent div must have display:flex in its CSS class
